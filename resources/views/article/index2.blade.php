                    In the midst of technological and social media growth, the new trend in marketing is growing rapidly.
                    One
                    of the trends that's getting attention is social commerce. If you're familiar with the term, social
                    commerce refers to the process of buying and selling products directly on social media platforms,
                    without leaving the application behind. For example, consumers can purchase products directly from
                    instagram, ticktock, or facebook by purchasing processes integrated with their social media experience.

                    With growing social media use and technological progress, social commerce is expected to be one of the
                    key items in the world of sales in 2025. In this article, we will discuss what social commerce is, why
                    this trend is important, and how the brand can use it to enhance sales and the brand awareness.

                <br>
                <p><b>What is Social Commerce</b></p>
                <p>Social commerce is a shopping hub on a social media platform, whether it's through a feed, a story, or
                    even a live stream. In addition to traditional e-commerce that requires customers to visit specific
                    websites or applications, social commerce makes it easier for customers to purchase products without
                    leaving behind the social media they are currently using. Features such as instagram shopping, shop
                    tytock, and facebook updates are examples of social commerce currently in high use</p>
                <br>
                <p>With social commerce, the shopping experience is smoother and blends with the social media experience.
                    Consumers can find the product through the content they see in the feed, click to look at the product
                    details, and make immediate purchases without having to visit another page.</p>

            <div class="content-desc">
                <p><b>Why is social commerce important?</b></p>
                <p>1. Increasing use of social media
                    <br>
                <div class="p-cont">
                    Almost everyone is now actively using social media, using platforms such as instagram,
                    facebook, ticktock, and others that have billions of active users. According to statista (2024),
                    more than 4.7 billion people worldwide use social media, and the number continues to rise every
                    year. With this enormous number of users, social commerce is giving the brand a huge opportunity to
                    reach out to the consumers in their time space.

                <p>2. Enhance the easier and faster experience of shopping
                    <br>
                <div class="p-cont">
                    With social commerce, the purchase process becomes faster and easier. Consumers do not have to
                    change applications or open pages to do transactions. They can look at ads, look for products, and
                    buy right away in just a few clicks. According to a report by emarketers (2024), more than 60% of
                    consumers say they prefer to shop live from social media platforms because of this convenience.

                <p>3. Reaching out to younger consumers
                    <br>
                <div class="p-cont">
                    Young generations, especially genes z and millennial, are familiar with social media and are more
                    likely to purchase the products they see on this platform. Reports from the hootsuite (2024) show
                    that about 70% of genes z and 60% of milenlylyprefer to spend products via social media rather than
                    traditional online shopping sites. It makes social commerce an effective conduit to reach

                <p>4. Are more connected with consumers through interesting content
                    <br>
                <div class="p-cont">
                    Social commerce gives the brand the opportunity to interact directly with audiences through such
                    compelling content as short videos, live streaming, or stories. For example, brand can use the
                    feature instagram to demonstrate products directly and answer questions from audiences. It creates
                    more interactive and more personal shopping experiences, which can increase the likelihood of
                    purchase. Deloitte (2024) notes that a brand focusing on interactive experiences tends to have a
                    higher conversion rate.

                <p>5. Integrate the features of direct payment
                    <br>
                <div class="p-cont">
                    Social media platforms now provide a feature of payment that allows customers to purchase products
                    directly from applications, such as instagram checkout or ticktock shops. This feature is
                    particularly advantageous because it reduces the steps needed to complete the transaction, which
                    ultimately increases the sales conversion rate. According to forrester research (2024), over 50% of
                    consumers prefer to shop for products they find on social media because of their easy, quick
                    pausing.

                        where the audience can view the product in real-time and directly buy it at a click. McKinsey (2024)
